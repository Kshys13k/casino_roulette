Simple script to simulate martingale betting strategy in european roulette.

I created this script to prove to my friends that my belief in being able to win against the casino in this negative-sum game doesn't stem from stupidity, but rather from a winner's mentality.

Type: "python casino_roulette.py --help" to get help.

Output explanation:
Games played - number of games that has been played
Money gained - account balance / how much money was gained/lost in all games
Biggest bet - value of the biggest bet
Max loss - the lowest account balance in history of the simulation
Number of games on minus - for how many games account balance was below zero
